       "\" ,  Scalability  and Other Challenges . Briefly, it can be said that due to blockchain's authenticity, integrity,  privacy, and shared nature, IoT networks would benefit greatly from making use of blockchain  technology. This can be realized in the form of an IoT network that runs on a blockchain, and  makes use of a decentralized  mesh network  for communication in order to facilitate  Machine- to-Machine  ( M2M ) communication in real time.  All of the data that is generated as a result of M2M communication can be used in  machine  learning  processes to augment the functionality of artificially intelligent DAOs or simple AAs.  These AAs can act as agents in a blockchain-provided  Distributed Artificial Intelligence  ( DAI )  environment, which can learn over time using machine learning processes. This would enable  them to make better decisions for the good of the blockchain. AI is a field of computer science that endeavors to build intelligent agents that can make rational  decisions based on the scenarios and environment that they observe around them. Machine  learning plays a vital role in AI technology, by making use of raw data as a learning resource.  A key requirement in AI-based systems is the availability of authentic data that can be used  for machine learning and model building. Therefore, the explosion of data coming out of IoT  devices, smartphones, and other means of data acquisition means that AI and machine learning  is becoming more and more powerful. There is, however, a requirement for data authenticity,  which is where the convergence with blockchain comes in. Once consumers, producers, and  other entities are on a blockchain, the data that is generated as a result of interaction between  these entities can be readily used as an input to machine learning engines with a guarantee of  authenticity. It could also be argued that if an IoT device is hacked, it could send malformed data to the  blockchain. This issue would be mitigated using blockchain technology, because an IoT device  would be part of the blockchain (as a node) and would have the same security properties  applied to it as a standard node in the blockchain network. These properties include the  incentivization of good behavior, rejection of malformed transactions, strict verification of  transactions, and various other checks that are part of blockchain protocol. Therefore, even if an  IoT device is hacked, it would be treated as a  Byzantine node  by the blockchain network and  would not cause any adverse impact on the network. The possibility of combining intelligent oracles, intelligent smart contracts, and AAs will give  rise to  Artificially Intelligent Decentralized Autonomous Organizations  ( AIDAOs ) that can  act on behalf of humans to run entire organizations on their own. This is another side of AI that  could potentially become normal in the future. However, more research is required to realize  this vision. The convergence of blockchain technology with various other fields, such as 3D printing, virtual  reality, augmented reality, spatial computing, and the gaming industry, is also envisaged.  For example, in a multiplayer online game, blockchain's decentralized approach allows more  transparency, and can ensure that no central authority is gaining an unfair advantage by  manipulating game rules. Each of these topics are currently active areas of research, and more  interest and development is expected. Now, let's discuss the future of blockchain technology, and make some predictions about  its development.\""
